# Chrome Snippets #

Every javascript file is a snippet that can be saved as a 
snippet in Chrome Dev Tools or used directly through the 
javascript console which is also in Chrome Dev Tools.

A snippet used to keep the list of the methods on the 
right side of the page so you don't have to scroll back 
to the top each time you wanna see a specific method.

It also adds a small button on the top right corner to
return to the top of the page so you don't have to scroll.
